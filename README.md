<h1>Document</h1>

<p>this document contains information related web development, programming logic, codding pattern which helps developer help develop web applicaton of other software </p>

<p> most beginners have no idea of how to develop productive application because of poor documentations , lack of resource on learning productive application, lack of productive programming examples, most of books teach just how to program, do not teach how to create software from groud-up with planning and structure so growing your project will not create difficulties to organize your files and code </p>

<p> in upcoming tutorials we will learn how to develop applicatioins from scratch, most of app we will develop will be web app in core HTML5, CSS3 and Core Javascrip (new javascript ecma) which shows you develop app just using logic instead of using other libraries of framework </p>

<p>using any framework or library of any programming to develop application decreases your time but before use libraries you should learn core programming concept so you can develop your own library for your needs
